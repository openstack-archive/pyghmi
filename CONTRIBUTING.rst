If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack, you must
follow the steps in this page:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

If you already have a good understanding of how the system works and your
OpenStack accounts are set up, you can skip to the development workflow
section of this documentation to learn how changes to OpenStack should be
submitted for review via the Gerrit tool:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on StoryBoard, not GitHub:

   https://storyboard.openstack.org/
