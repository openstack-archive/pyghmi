#this is a quick sample of how to write something that acts like a bmc
#to play:
# run fakebmc
## ipmitool -I lanplus -U admin -P password -H 127.0.0.1 power status
# Chassis Power is off
# # ipmitool -I lanplus -U admin -P password -H 127.0.0.1 power on
# Chassis Power Control: Up/On
# # ipmitool -I lanplus -U admin -P password -H 127.0.0.1 power status
# Chassis Power is on
# # ipmitool -I lanplus -U admin -P password -H 127.0.0.1 mc reset cold
# Sent cold reset command to MC
# (fakebmc exits)
import pyghmi.ipmi.bmc as bmc
